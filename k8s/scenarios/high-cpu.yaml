# =============================================================================
# SCENARIO 4: High CPU Utilization - Resource Exhaustion
# =============================================================================
# This scenario deploys a stress test pod that consumes excessive CPU,
# affecting other workloads and triggering alerts.
#
# SRE Agent can diagnose: High CPU usage, resource contention, recommend
# scaling, resource limits, or investigating the workload.
#
# HOW TO BREAK:
# kubectl apply -f k8s/scenarios/high-cpu.yaml
#
# HOW TO FIX:
# kubectl delete deployment cpu-stress-test -n pets
